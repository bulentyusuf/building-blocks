// Two gaps this closes.
//
// One: nothing tested the accent's contrast. tag-pill.test.ts covers the control
// edge only, and app/a11y.test.tsx disables axe's color-contrast rule because
// jsdom computes no boxes and would report a false pass. So the crimson token
// could drift back below AAA with every check green.
//
// Two: three literal hexes exist because they CANNOT read the tokens — Satori has
// no custom properties, and the search emblem's ground stays cream in both
// schemes. Those are deliberate, and nothing held them to the values they
// duplicate. The OG card is the one that would go unnoticed longest: it renders
// in its own request, into a PNG, that nobody looks at day to day.
//

// they clear 7:1 today, so the guard records that rather than the lower floor
// they already passed.
